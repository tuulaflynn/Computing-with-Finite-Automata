# Computing-with-Finite-Automata
![Report Heading](heading.JPG)

My final year maths report which I wrote on finite automata in 2021. 
I researched the topic for 3 months; reading books/academic papers, going to
lectures on the subject and completing exercises. Then,
it took me 4 months to write the report alongside continued research and
other university maths work. 

## What is automata?
Automata is the plural of automaton. 
An automaton is a self-operating machine that performs a series of predetermined actions - 
almost the most basic computer! 

A finite automaton is a mathematical model
used to represent a system that can be in one of a finite number of states at 
any given time.
The predetemined actions are a set of input symbols (an input string)
which the automaton reads 
and uses to transitions between states with the aid of a transition function.
If a final state is reached, the automaton accepts the input string,
otherwise the input string is rejected.
